She had actually been a schoolmate of his while a child in Germany, the daughter of Berthold Von Auerbach of Frankfort-on-the-Main, who had come to Davenport, like many Germans, to live.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, Isaac Rothschild advertised the very latest fad - black lamb's wool underwear!\r\n\r\nWhen the Ringling Bros. Circus came to town in May 1895, the much anticipated occasion was accompanied by a number of robberies and thefts, the chief of which was the burglarizing of Isaac Rothschildâs residence. While much of Davenport lined the downtown streets to see the circus parade, the thieves absconded with the goods, mostly jewelry, valued at $1,000.\r\n\r\nIsaac Rothschild remained in business until about 1899 when he was forced to file for bankruptcy. In 1900 he became a clerk for Mosenfelder & Kohn Clothiers and the following year began a 14-year career with the J.H.C. Petersenâs Sonsâ Department Store.

Hyman & Co., Diamond Merchants and Jewellers, State and Madison Streets.âNo historical review of the rise and progress of the representative houses in each branch of mercantile activity would be complete without careful reference to the house of Messrs. S. Hyman & Co., the leading firm of diamond-merchants and jewellers in Chicago. The house was founded by Mr. Charles Wendell in 1859, first being located at No. 87 Lake Street. The business steadily grew in importance, and in 1866 Mr. S. Hyman, the respected senior of the present firm, entered into co-partnership with Mr. Wendell, under the name and style of Wendell & Hyman, the new firm at the same time removing to enlarged premises at No. 99 Lake Street, where they remained, prosperous, and energetically extending their trade, until the calamitous fire of October, 1871, in a few hours had reduced their establishment to ashes. Nothing daunted, the partners sought out other premises, and with difficulty secured a temporary office on Wabash Avenue, near Harman Court, whence they shifted to Wabash Avenue, corner of Jackson Street. At length, in 1877, the concern was finally removed to its present spacious and splendid quarters, State, corner of Madison Street. This year was also the date of the dissolution of the old house of Wendell & Hyman, Mr. Hyman becoming sole proprietor, and thus continuing until 1877, when he formed a co-partnership with Mr. M. H. Berg, under the existing firm-name. The members of the firm are authorities in all that pertains to the jewelry trade. They are experts in the diamond market, and bring to bear the widest possible range of practical experience, coupled with an intimate knowledge of the wants of the public. Their stock is the largest and choicest in Chicago, and is set off and displayed in their magnificent show-rooms in a manner to reflect the greatest credit upon their good taste and sound judgment. The visitor to their establishment is at once favorably impressed with the thorough system of organization observable. The finest French walnut and mahogany show-cases, extending in double rows for 150 feet in extent, with a handsome semicircle in front, while upon the right is an open display upon a raised dais, a unique feature, and duly appreciated by customers. The efficient lighting of this elegant show-room is effected by means of Siemens' incandescent lights, throwing a purer and more brilliant fight than that of gas produced by the ordinary process, and by means of which the color of gems can be accurately observed. The limits of this work do not afford space in which to describe the contents of the various departments of Messrs. Hyman & Co.'s establishment; suffice it to say that they have long made a specialty of diamonds, importing large consignments of the choicest pure-water brilliants, including many large solitaires, all the way from one carat up to twenty or thirty in size, and some of which represent small fortunes. They have the largest and finest stock of diamond jewelry in the city, and are prepared to promptly mount stones in any desired fashion. In precious stones also they have achieved merited distinction, and show a magnificent stock of rubies, emeralds, sapphires, pearls, opals, turquoises, alexandrites. etc., etc., and possess many matched stones of rare beauty which cannot be readily duplicated. Their facilities for the securing of the finest diamonds and precious stones are unsurpassed. They personally make their selections with the greatest care and discrimination; and their splendid stock is the result, containing as it does more perfect steel-white gems than any other collection in the West. Their prices are moderate, based solely on the intrinsic value of the stones and settings; and purchasers of diamond jewelry from this firm make one of the best investments of their money possible. The firm is also foremost in exhibiting seasonable styles and novelties in solid gold jewelry, and their business is yearly growing in magnitude. Their line of fine watches is unrivalled; and in this department, as in all others, absolute satisfaction is guaranteed both as to price and quality. Mr. Hyman is one of Chicago's oldest established and certainly best known jewellers. He has been a permanent resident of this city for thirty-one years past, and has during that period achieved the highest of reputations for his honorable methods and sterling integrity. Mr. Berg is a native of New York, and has been identified with the best class of the jewelry trade from his first entering commercial life, and his career has abundantly demonstrated his talents and superior executive abilities.",

Attributed to Gilbert Stuart (American, 1755-1828)â¦ Circa 1790â¦ oil on canvasâ¦  25 x 20 inches.  \r\n\r\nMoses Michael Hays (1739-1805) was arguably the most important Jewish citizen of Colonial and early Federalist America. He was a merchant, civic leader, philanthropist, and longtime Freemason, who lived in New York, Boston and Newport, Rhode Island. In 1769, Hays was admitted as a Freeman of the City of New York, where his occupation is listed as watchmaker. (Harry Smith and J. Hugo Tasch, Moses Michael Hays: Merchant- Citizen- Freemason (Boston, Moses Michael Hays Lodge A.F. & A.M., 1937) p. 33)\r\n\r\nHays was also a family man. He married Rachel Myers Hays (1738-1810), the sister of New York silversmith Myer Myers (1723-1795), on August 13, 1766, and together they had six children- Judith, Rebecca, Catherine, Judah, Sarah, and Slowey. Judah (1772-1832) was their lone son and was a founder of the Boston Atheneum. (ibid, p.39) They also helped raise the children of Moses Michael's deceased sister, Reyna Hays Touro (1743-1787)- Judah (1775-1854), Abraham (1777-1822) and Rebecca Hays (1779-1833).\r\n\r\nMoses Michael was born in New York City on May 9, 1739, to Judah Hays (1703-1764) and Rebecca Michaels (1709-1801). Judah, immigrated to New York City in 1720 from Holland, along with his five brothers- Jacob, Isaac, Solomon, Abraham, and David. Judah was naturalized in 1729 and recorded as a Freeman in New York City on December 2, 1735. He became a successful ship merchant, and in October 1760, one of his ships, The Duke of Cumberland, was granted a privateer commission. The small, 160-ton ship was fitted with sixteen guns and carried a crew of fifty, to prey on enemy vessels and commerce during the French and Indian War. (ibid, pp. 28-29)\r\n\r\nIt is thought that Hays moved his family from New York to Boston after Washington withdrew from the Battle of Long Island in August 1776. Upon arriving in Boston, Hays engaged in the insurance business opening an office at 68 State Street. He prospered in this field and gained the respect and confidence of those he worked with. Soon after the end of the Revolutionary War, the leading merchants of Boston, including Moses Michaels Hays, saw the need for a bank and took steps to form one during the winter of 1783-84. On July 5, 1784, they successfully opened Massachusetts Bank, now the Bank of America. The first name entered on the bank ledge was that of Moses Michael Hays, whose initial deposit was $14,500. (ibid, p.36)\r\n\r\nHays came to Freemasonry as a young man. A 1769 warrant issued by Provincial Grand Master of the 'Moderns\"Â in New York, George Harison, appoints Moses Michael Hays to be 'Master of King David's Lodge in the city of New York.\"Â He later took the warrant to Newport, Rhode Island where he opened the third lodge in that state in June 1780. (ibid, pp. 45-46) Hays also served as Master of the Massachusetts Lodge of Boston from December 1782 to May of 1785 when the lodge was closed. When it reopened in 1788, Hays served as Grand Master until 1792. When he once again reelection to the post in 1791, he appointed Paul Revere to be his deputy.\r\n\r\nMoses Michael Hays died on his 64th birthday, May 9, 1805. A few days later the Boston Centinel posted a tribute to his memory:\r\n\r\n\"On Thursday evening, M.M. Hays, Esq Aet 64. [sic] In the character of the deceased, there is much worthy of our admiration- much for our imitation. Possessed by nature of a strong intellect, there was a vigor in his conceptions of men and things which gave a seeming asperity to his conversation, which was ever frank and lucid. He walked abroad fearing no man, but loving all. Under his roof dwelt hospitality- it was an asylum for friendship, the mansion of piece. He was without guile, detesting hypocrisy as he despised meanness. Take him for all in all, he was indeed a man. In his death, society will mourn the loss of a most valuable citizen; his family, the kindest of husbands, the most indulgent of fathers. But what consolation shall we offer to assuage the violence of their grief?- Why, this is all- the recollection of his virtues;- and that as he lived, so he died: that to his last moment the cheerfulness and benevolence of his whole life, wasted not on his falling brow. Calm, and without a sigh, he sunk to rest, and is now secure in the bosom of his Father and our Father, of his God and our God.\" (ibid, p. 42)\r\n\r\nThe Appendix Harry Smith and J. Hugo Tasch's 1937 Moses Michael Hays: Merchant- Citizen-Freemason discusses portraits of the Hays family, suggesting that the current work may depict Hays' eldest son Judah.\r\n\r\n\"Only one portrait is extant of Moses Michael Hays. It is a copy of an original attributed to Gilbert Stuart, destroyed by fire at Richmond, and is now hanging in the Masonic Temple at Boston. The frontispiece which adorns this volume is from a photographic copy of the Temple painting.\r\n\r\nA portrait of Hays' son, Judah, which was not destroyed in the fire that ruined the one of the father, is still in Richmond being owned by Mrs. William C. Preston of that city.\r\n\r\nPortraits also exist, by Stuart, of other members of the family, notably Samuel Myers, Moses Myers and Mrs. Moses Myers'\r\n\r\nLawrence Park's Gilbert Stuart: An Illustrated Descriptive List of his Works, Vol. 1 (1926, New York) discusses the above-mentioned portrait of Judah, which is listed as catalog number 386, on page 392. It goes on to describe the painting, and that it had been badly scorched by a fire in 1912. The portrait of Judah was passed to his brother in-law, Samuel Myers (1755-1836) of Richmond, Virginia, then passed to his daughter, Ella Myers, who died unmarried in 1892. The portrait was then inherited by her nephew, Major Edward Dana Trowbridge Myers, then to his daughter Elizabeth Myer, who married William C. Preston of Richmond, Virginia. It was then passed down through the Preston family to the current owner. This pair of portraits descended along the same family line and were likely descended in the family of Moses and Rachel's eldest daughter, Judith.\r\n\r\n\r\nProvenance:\r\nJudith Myers (1767-1844), the eldest child of Moses Michael and Rebecca Myers Hays, who married Samuel Myers (1755-1836);\r\nto their son, Samuel Hays Myers (1799-1849), who married Elizabeth Kennon Mordecai (1809-1861);\r\nto their son, Edmund Trowbridge Dana Myers (1830-1905), who married Frances Colquhoun Trigg (1838-1899);\r\nto their eldest daughter, Eliza Kennon Myers (1860-1934) who married William Carruthers Preston (1862-1901);\r\nto their son, Edmund Myers Preston (1898-1945), who married Jane Daves Strudwick (1899-1996);\r\nto their eldest daughter, Elizabeth Myers Preston (1926-2017), who married John Barclay Lottimer (1922-2007),\r\nto their children, the present owners.\r\n\r\nProvenance: Collection descended in the family of circa 1840 Jewish settlers in Cincinnati, OH. The Ohio settlement is the oldest Jewish community west of Appalachia. The current heirs include the president of an international literary society who retired from New Jersey to central Florida.
